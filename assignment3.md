# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

## Step one: find a data visualization (with data you can use!)

- The embedded code does not work for this file, so I just paste the link here:
- [Critique Data Source - Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityAdvancementDonationsandGiving/Dashboard1?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link)
- Author: himaja ravi
- Data source: [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-gb/s/resources) University Advancement, Donations, and Giving
This is a table of donations made to Universities in the United States. The donation amounts and locations in this data set are not real as they are intended for training purposes only.

## Step two: critique the data visualization

- Your name: Yuhan He

- What visualization are you ranking? Provide the title and web-accessible URL.

- Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here. What stood out to you? What did you find worked really well? What didn't? What, if anything, would you do differently? *
- Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.
- This data visualization contains four parts, with two bar charts, one bubble chart and one map.
Informative: The donation amounts and locations in this data set are not real as they are intended for training purposes only. However, if we consider the data as real data, it is still not very informative. Two charts in it contain similar information and is not complete. In the original dataset, there is more information to show.

- Emotive: The author uses many colors for the chart, it makes the dashboard complex. Also, there is no focus for each chart, thus it does not deliver very clear information to audiences.

- What stood out to you? 
- The colors the author chosen is various and there are different types of chart in the dashboard.
There are three different chart types.

- What did you find worked really well? What didn't?
- When expressing Donations by Major data, the author used descending order to show which major has made the most donations to the school.
It only shows some information about university donations. However, the message the author would like to deliver is quite vague. 
The first two pictures have too many colors, making it difficult for the audience to find the point that the author wants to express.
In addition, the size difference of each bubble in the bubble chart is not very large, and it is difficult for the audience to understand the author's intention to put this picture.

What, if anything, would you do differently? 
I'll replace the bar graph showing the total donation with a line chart so that I can see the change in total donations more clearly between years. 
At the same time, I will not use so many colors to distract the audience, but use gray appropriately to represent the less important data.
Highest Donations by College and Donations by Major have similarities in the information they want to express to a certain extent. If they are modified, I will keep only one of the two pictures and replace the other with other data. For instance, use the gift allocation data to create the fourth chart.

- Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not?
- The audience is mainly school staff who manage donations and other information or state officials who manage donations to schools. For example, the staff of the government education department.
I do not think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience. Firstly, it does not extract enough information from the original dataset. In addition, it might be confusing for the audience to understand the key point of the dashboard. Furthermore, the chart type the author chooses is not very suitable for the data content.

- Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here? What would you change? Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)
- This method is quite successful at evaluating the data visualisation I selected. I would recommend to add the layout and color evaluation. Because in a dashboard, the consistency of color and harmony is quite significant. If the chart contains uncoordinated color, the audiences' focus might be distracted. For the layout, it is very significant to make the whole dashboard logically fluent. Thus, I would like to recommend to add these two evaluation standards.

## Step three: wireframe a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

## Step five: Build your solution
