# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

## Step one: find a data visualization (with data you can use!)

- The embedded code does not work for this file, so I just paste the link here:
- [Critique Data Source - Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityAdvancementDonationsandGiving/Dashboard1?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link)

- Data source: [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-gb/s/resources) University Advancement, Donations, and Giving
This is a table of donations made to Universities in the United States. The donation amounts and locations in this data set are not real as they are intended for training purposes only.

## Step two: critique the data visualization


## Step three: wireframe a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

## Step five: Build your solution

## Go further (optional)...
