## User research
### User research protocol
#### a target audience
- I have three main target audiences: The first category is the current MISM-Global students. Through the employment reports of graduated students in the past, they can adjust your own job hunting strategies accordingly. The second category is students who want to apply for the MISM-Global program. Knowing more specific employment information can help them decide whether to apply for the program. The third category is the instructors of the Employment Service Office. Through the analysis of past employment reports, the instructors can make better suggestions in the process of students finding jobs.
#### b representative individuals
- According to the scope of my audience, because the feedback from the employment service staff is difficult to obtain, I selected a student from the MISM global project, a student from the MEIM project, and an undergraduate who wanted to apply for the MISM global project as my interviewees.
#### c interview script
- Introduction
- Hi, my name is Yuhan, this is the final project of my telling stories with data course, and I need feedback from my target audience. You have been selected as my interviewee. I hope you can objectively evaluate your thoughts on this project and answer some of my questions.
- Questions
1. Looking at this framework, what do you think the project wants to express? Please tell me which part of the project leads you to this idea.
2. Do you think the logic of the whole story is clear?
3. Do you have the feeling of engagement when looking at the project?
4. Do you think these chart visualizations clearly convey the point of view of the project?
5. Do you think the icons and words provide enough information to convey your point of view? What else do you think needs to be added or deleted?
6. How does the project feel to you overall? What part do you find confusing?
7. What will you do after viewing this story?
8. Do you have any other suggestions that can help me improve the entire project?

### Documented finding
#### d findings
- Positive feedback
1. The charts showing the main employers are beautiful. The graph showing the proportion of each job offer is beautiful.
2. The logic of the whole story is relatively clear, divided into three parts.
3. The information about employers, job types and geographic locations that are mainly to be transmitted can also be well transmitted to the audience.
- Negative feedback
1. The color tone of the entire project is messy, and a uniform color tone can make the webpage more beautiful.
2. The whole story wants to express too much information, you can appropriately delete some unnecessary charts, or merge some charts that can be used for comparison. It is only necessary to keep one employment ratio figure. For example, you can add some US average salary data to compare with existing data. 
3. The final summary can be written more clearly and write down what you want the audience to do.

#### e changes you implemented to your sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified.
- Changes for the wireframe: Remove some redundant information, such as employment rate. Make new chart for the top 10 employers of which the employees apply most H1B. Change the main color to blue, remove the red chart part. Change the layout of the page. Add the call for action part at the end.
