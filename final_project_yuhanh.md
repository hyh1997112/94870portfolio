# Part I: a project proposal
## An outline
### High level summary
**Find a job based on senior's experience.**

In this project, I would like to visualize the career report of MISM global track at Heinz College to give some instructions to the current students in MISM program or students who want to apply for the program. The career reports on the Heinz website are in pdf format and it is very difficult to view the changes through years. Thus, I would like to visualize the MISM global track career data, including the employment rate, average salary, number of students who got offers from big companies. Showing these data could help current students or students who want to choose the program have a better career sight.

(In the MISM: Global pathway, you will spend the first year at CMU Australia in Adelaide, South Australia, and join us in Pittsburgh for year two. In the first summer vacation, the student will have an internship experience in countries around the world except US.)
### Project structure
* Introduce the program of MISM global. 
* The average salary of students has remained at a relatively high level. And the average salary has been increasing. The maximum salary has also increased.
* The number of students in the project is increasing, and the employment situation has changed accordingly. Although the number of people in the project has increased, the employment rate has declined, and the employment rate will fall below 90% in 2019. Nevertheless, the employment rate for MISM global programs is relatively high in the US. 
* Thus, further analysis of the specific circumstances of admissions received by previous students is needed to increase the employment rate. For example, large companies like fb, google, etc. take students in this directory. As well as the positions that students have been accepted into.
* By summarizing the above information, provide some suggestions and guidance for students of MISM global project and general mism project.

## Initial sketches


## The data
* The main source of data is the official heinz website. On the website, you can see the employment statistics of MISM global students from 2014 to 2019 as of May.
* The content of the report is mainly presented in text form. The main information is as follows.
1. The number of students in the project.
2. The number of graduated students.
3. The number of students who have an offer in the statistics.
4. The company, position and location of the student offer.
5. Statistics about wages.
6. Geographical distribution.
* The main data used in this project is derived from this.

## Method and medium
The final visualization, I want to use **shorthand** to render.

Because shorthand is a platform for storytelling with data. 

In addition, for data-related icons, I intend to implement them using platforms such as **infogram and tableau**.
