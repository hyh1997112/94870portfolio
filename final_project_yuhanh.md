# Part I: a project proposal
## An outline
### High level summary
**Find a job based on senior's experience.**

In this project, I would like to visualize the career report of MISM global track at Heinz College to give some instructions to the current students in MISM program or students who want to apply for the program. The career reports on the Heinz website are in pdf format and it is very difficult to view the changes through years. Thus, I would like to visualize the MISM global track career data, including the employment rate, average salary, number of students who got offers from big companies. Showing these data could help current students or students who want to choose the program have a better career sight.

(In the MISM: Global pathway, you will spend the first year at CMU Australia in Adelaide, South Australia, and join us in Pittsburgh for year two. In the first summer vacation, the student will have an internship experience in countries around the world except US.)
### Project structure
* Introduce the program of MISM global. 
* The average salary of students has remained at a relatively high level. And the average salary has been increasing. The maximum salary has also increased.
* The number of students in the project is increasing, and the employment situation has changed accordingly. Although the number of people in the project has increased, the employment rate has declined, and the employment rate will fall below 90% in 2019. Nevertheless, the employment rate for MISM global programs is relatively high in the US. 
* Thus, further analysis of the specific circumstances of admissions received by previous students is needed to increase the employment rate. For example, large companies like fb, google, etc. take students in this directory. As well as the positions that students have been accepted into. Also, include some data from the OFLC so to show the trend of foreign labor employment.
* By summarizing the above information, provide some suggestions and guidance for students of MISM global project and general mism project.

## Initial sketches
* First, we will introduce the basic information of the project. So in this section there will be some charts showing basic statistics.
* Second, data related to employment information is presented. This part of the data is mainly from two sources, one is the official website of heinz, and the other is the employment data of OFLC.
* Finally, make a corresponding summary based on the previous chart and information.
* p.s. The data used for the sketch might not be the real data. The chart used here may not be used in the final page.

## The data
* The main source of data is the official heinz website. On the website, you can see the employment statistics of MISM global students from 2014 to 2019 as of May.
* The information dilivery by the report is mainly on text. However, the data could be converted to numbers so that is is better for the audience to understand the report easily.
* The content of the report is mainly presented in text form. The main information is as follows.
1. The number of students in the project.
2. The number of graduated students.
3. The number of students who have an offer in the statistics.
4. The company, position and location of the student offer.
5. Statistics about wages.
6. Geographical distribution.
* The main data used in this project is derived from this.
* Data from Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) should be used to give some suggestions to the students.

## Method and medium
The final visualization, I want to use **shorthand** to render.

First, I will use platforms such as **tableau and infogram** to make raw data visualization diagrams.

Secondly, I will post visual charts on shorthand, plus text explanations. After reviewing the entire website, modify the visual chart data and type accordingly, and select the chart with a better presentation form.

Finally, add charts and text again, review the entire webpage, and listen to others. Make the final **shorthand** link after making changes.
